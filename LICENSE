                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free softwareâ€”to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can
use it for your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can
get it if you want it, that you can change the software and
distribute your changes, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly
explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both
users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be
marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed
unfairly to authors of previous versions.

  Some people call this kind of license a "copyleft" license. This
means that, when you distribute copies or modified versions of the
software, you have to pass on the same freedoms to the recipients.
You must distribute the source code, and you must keep the GPL
license intact so that everyone else also has these freedoms.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
modified version will add an additional restriction on the
users' freedom. Therefore, we insist that any patent must be
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. 

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to
other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensor"
means the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright
owner that grants you the License.

   "Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. "Object Code" means any non-source
form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or,
in the absence of an official standard, is widely used among
developers and users of software.

   "Modifying" a work means changing the work or producing a
new work based on the original work.

   "You" means the individual or legal entity exercising this
License.

  1. Source Code.

   The Licensor must make the Source Code available to the
Licensees, either by distributing the Source Code along with
the Object Code, or by providing a written offer, valid for
at least three years, to give any third party a copy of the
Source Code, or by providing a copy of the Source Code on a
publicly available network server.

  2. Basic Permissions.

   You may copy, modify and distribute the Program, either as
original or modified, provided that you include a copy of
this License and preserve the copyright notice on all copies
or substantial portions of the Program.

  3. Copyleft.

   The modifications and derivative works that you create and
distribute must be licensed under the same terms as this
License.

  4. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   There is no warranty for the Program, and it is provided on
an "as-is" basis.

  5. Limitation of Liability.

   The Licensor will not be liable for any damages arising out
of the use or inability to use the Program.

  6. Acceptance Not Required for Using the Program.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to
use the Program. However, nothing else grants you permission
to modify or distribute the Program.

  7. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   You are automatically licensed to distribute copies or
modifications of the Program to downstream recipients.

  8. Your Activities.

   You must not impose any additional restrictions on the rights
granted by this License.

  9. Termination.

   If you fail to comply with any of the terms of this License,
your rights under it will terminate.

  10. Future Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new versions of the
GNU General Public License from time to time. You may choose
to follow the terms and conditions of any version published
after the version you received this License from.

  11. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   There is no warranty for the Program, and it is provided on
an "as-is" basis. 

  12. Limitation of Liability.

   The Licensor will not be liable for any damages arising out
of the use or inability to use the Program.
